		<h1>Footloose</h1>
		<p>The movie Footloose is a story of a teenage boy, Ren McCormack, played by Kevin Bacon. Ren moves to a small town from Chicago with his mom. He loves to dance and is a <em>total fox</em>, but the small town has banned dancing after a group of teenagers died in the way back from a night out dancing and drinking. While not everyone is a fan of Ren's big city moves, he makes friends with the awkward country boy, Willard, who he teaches to dance and quickly falls for the miniter's daugher. For a movie set in a town without dancing, there is plenty of awesome dance numbers you'll want to reenact with all your friends. They redid the movie in 2011 but it is not as awesome, but still entertaining, since it is based on an amazing movie. </p>

		<strong>Ren: </strong>Ecclesiastes assures us... that there is a time for every purpose under heaven. A time to laugh... and a time to weep. A time to mourn... and there is a time to dance. And there was a time for this law, but not anymore. See, this is our time to dance. It is our way of celebrating life. It's the way it was in the beginning. It's the way it's always been. It's the way it should be now.</p>
